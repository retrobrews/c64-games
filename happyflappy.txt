Happy Flappy (C64 Flappy Bird clone)

A game for the C64  that can be played in your favourite Commodore 64 emulator or on hardware (PAL version only).
This is the uncracked, untrained version.

I'm afraid it's a tad glitchy. It was my first C64 game in about 21 years.

Simple casual game... a one button (press fire/space) game. Just like Flappy Bird. If you don't know Flappy Bird you can get in the sea.
