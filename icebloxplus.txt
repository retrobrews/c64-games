Psytronik Software is proud to present ICEBLOX PLUS, a C64 game by Karl Hörnell, 
who  produced C64 classics like Clean Up Service, Fungus and Velocipede.  
In this game you control Pixel Pete, the penguin.  The aim of the game is to 
collect gold coins trapped in ice.  You can push ice blocks around to snuff out 
the fire monsters that are roaming around the screens. Once you have collected 
all the gold coins you will move onto the next more challenging screen.

ICEBLOX PLUS is also available to order on physical floppy disk and tape from the 
Binary Zone Interactive retro store. Click HERE to buy your copy now! -->
