Genre	Shooter, Action, Adventure

For the Commodore 64 and emulators like VICE v3.x+:

You are the captain of the ATOM-X nuclear-powered spacecraft in this fine-tuned, full science-fiction adventure.

Tip: Read the instructions to ‘decipher’ possible tips. Your ATOM-X space craft has more than its Atomizer for its offensive capabilities, but you must learn your opponents and obstacles!
