INTRODUCTION

Everybody has their own philosophy of life. Zampo's is: "whatever goes in, comes
out". There's no changing your dear friend's mind. You care about him, and so
you tried in all possible ways.

"C'mon, don't over do it!" - you told him. And he answered: "No worries:
whatever goes in, comes out".
Some other time you tried with "You can't think about that - and only that - all
the time", yet the reply you got was always the same: "No worries: whatever goes
in, comes out".
Going for a dramatic "It will kill you!" only succeeded in making the inevitable
"No worries: whatever goes in, comes out" resound even more profoundly in your
ears.
The last time you tried, he stared back at you, spoke those foolish words once
again, strengthened the blow with "Remember", and finally added, with all the
solemnity of a Roman emperor: "QUOD INIT EXIT".

"If you can't beat them, join them", they say. And, indeed, there's nothing
else you can do. So now you're by his side in his ravenous quest...

HUD

The HUD is displayed in the bottom-center of the screen, and shows (from left to
right):
 * the current level;
 * the points countdown;
 * the belly satisfaction meter;
 * the toilet roll indicator;
 * the pill indicator;
 * the turbofart indicator.


GAMEPLAY

Each level starts with Zampo located in the center of the play area, which is
made of a number of platforms arranged in a unique way.
Zampo can:
 * run on the platforms;
 * jump onto upper platforms;
 * descend to lower platforms through the gaps in the platforms themselves;
 * dash briefly thanks to the turbofart.

Zampo needs to eat/drink constantly to avoid starvation and to reach full
satisfaction. Zampo's satisfaction is indicated by the belly satisfaction meter.
It decreases steadily (the higher the level, the faster the decrease rate) and,
if it depletes entirely, it triggers the game over. When the belly satisfaction
meter is maxed out, a toilet zips across on a platform other than the one which
Zampo is on: Zampo has to catch it before it disappears in order to complete
the level. If the toilet is missed, the game is over.

Food, drinks, and other items zip across horizontally on the platforms. Catching
them produces a different effect depending on the kind of the item caught:
 * food/drink item: increases the belly satisfaction meter by 1 snout;
 * poison vial: decreases the belly satisfaction meter by 1 snout, but also
   awards the turbofart;
 * pill: provides protection against the bad effects of the next poison vial
   that will be caught;
 * clock: halts the items, the belly satisfation meter, and the score countdown
   for 5 seconds;
 * toilet roll: allows Zampo catch the last food/drink item needed to max out
   the belly satisfaction meter.

TRIVIA

QUOD INIT EXIT is based on a very complex joke among the author and a circle of
his friends. When the first version was completed, it was given as a birthday
present to the guy who invented "Tutto ciò che entra, esce" (the Italian
equivalent of "Quod init exit", which, in turn, is the Latin for "Whatever goes
in comes out").
QUOD INIT EXIT has a sequel that provides extra (eating) fun: QUOD INIT EXIT IIm
