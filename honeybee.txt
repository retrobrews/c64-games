LOADING (DISK):



Insert disk.  Type LOAD “*”,8,1 (RETURN).  Once loaded type RUN (RETURN).
Follow the on-screen prompts to start the game.


LOADING (TAPE):

Hold down SHIFT and press RUN STOP.  Press PLAY on tape.
The program will now load and run automatically.


STORY:

Queen Bee is very annoyed at the fact that honey production is very low.  
Many of her worker bees are just too damn lazy.  Luckily, there's one 
reliable busy, but clumsy bee available for the job, and that is you, Buzzy ...

Queen Bee sends you out into the wild to bring back pollen so that bee 
farmers can produce more scrumptious honey for the villagers.  In order 
to do this, as Buzzy, you must go to the flowers in each of the 16 screens 
and pick out pollen from one flower.  You must then drop the pollen into 
the hive (from any height).  One you have pollen in your possession you 
are unable to pick any more up until it has been dropped into the bee hive.

If you drop pollen in the wrong place, or lose a life, you will have to 
restart the current level all over again.  Avoid crashing into buildings, 
rocks, flower stems, flowing water (waterfalls are okay though), tree 
branches, the ground, lava, and of course, the natural wildlife.

Queen Bee is very annoyed at the fact that honey production is very low. 
Many of her worker bees are just too damn lazy. Luckily there is one reliable 
busy but clumsy bee available for the job, and that is you, Buzzy!

Queen Bee sends you out into the wild to bring back pollen so that bee farmers 
can produce more scrumptious honey for the villagers. In order to do this, as 
Buzzy, you must go to each of the flowers on screen, collect the pollen, then 
deposit it (at any height) into the bee hive entrance. Should you drop the 
honey into the wrong place, or lose a life. You will have to start the current 
level all over again. Watch out for the wildlife and the other obstacles, like 
water, lava, rocks, branches, poisonous stems, and much more. Collision with 
rain water or waterfalls is okay.

After successfully completing a level, Buzzy will enter a bonus stage. In this
 stage, you must survive the cave of bats within a set time limit. Should you 
 complete this stage without bumping into anything bad, an extra life will be 
 rewarded. Failing to complete the bonus stage will just send you to the next 
 stage. The later the level, the more time you have to spend in the cave to 
 win extra lives. 

You will notice that during the game, the BT timer will count down. Should this
 reach zero, it will not affect loss of lives. This is the bonus timer. If you
  complete a level with any bonus time remaining, you'll get more points. 
  Therefore the further you progress, you could achieve a high score.

Extra lives are also awarded for every 10,000 points scored or for every 
successful bonus stage complete.

Can you complete all 16 levels and make Queen Bee proud?
