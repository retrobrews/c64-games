Find your way through a dangerous maze where all walls are poisoned. To reach the exit you have to die - a lot! 
Luckily you can collect your dead bodies to get back your lost live and continue your search for the right way to the exit.

This is my second C64 game for Ludum Dare. You have to find your way through a dangerous maze where all walls are poisoned. 
To reach the exit you have to die - a lot! Luckily you can collect your dead bodies to get back your lost live and continue
your search for the right way to the exit.

Attention: You need a real C64 or an emulator like WinVICE to play this game. 

Running on Windows
---
Download WinVICE from http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the files in a folder of your choise. Copy everything 
from the Commodore 64-zip (mazeofdeath.zip) into the WinVICE folder. Run start.bat to automatically run Maze of Death in the 
emulator. Use numpad to play the game. If you prefer a gamepad go to Settings > Joystick settings > Joystick settings… 
and select your gamepad from the select box of Joystick #2. In this dialog you can also create your personal control scheme.

Running on other systems

Unfortunaly I can’t provide any help to make Maze of Death work on OSX or Linux. But steps should be similar.
