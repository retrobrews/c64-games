Okay, call me brave... or stupid, but I'm posting up this bloomin' awful game. Terrible.
It's the first game I did for the old Commodore 64 8 bit computer that I actually got some money for.
Yeah I know! Money for this crap!
Anyway, it's now here for posterity to show you how NOT to make a game. 
The premise of the game is fine, but the implementation is lacking, to say the least.
The game was coded without an assembler, but by coding straight into memory using a "freeze cartridge".

Basically, this cartridge would "freeze" the computer and allow you to code machine code instructions 
straight into memory. I would never have the patience for this now.
The game is a simple run and gun scenario with some dubious combat sections. Simply make your way around 
the obstacle course 3 times to gain access to the fight room. This is a kind of Running Man thing. 
The better you do, the more years you can shave off your prison sentence. Hence the name! Clever eh?
No?
Well, meh...whatever.

Play it on your fave C64 emulator (eg. WinVice) or hardware.  
If you have the means to get the file onto hardware, I'm sure I don't need to explain the process. 
If not, just use emulator, buddy.
