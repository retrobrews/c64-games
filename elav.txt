Well, this game is also dedicated to my young friend
This is my 11th game for C64

Music created and composed by Nata
Bug fixes and size reduction by iAN CooG/HokutoForce

CONCEPT:
A Rampage clone

BACKGROUND:
I find alway difficult to pass screen in Rampage, but I like it. So I try to make a more playable version

INSTRUCTIONS:
Put Joystick in port 2
Use SID 8580 

Movement:
 LEFT:       goes left
 RIGHT:      goes right
 UP:         climb up (you may be near the buildings, but not between it)

when climbed at LEFT side:
 RIGHT       damage a wall 
 FIRE+RIGHT: damage a window/door
 LEFT        jump down

when climber at RIGHT side
 LEFT        damage a wall 
 FIRE+LEFT:  damage a window/door
 RIGHT       jump down


You have to destroy all the buildings to pass the level.
You lose a live if you are not able to make this in 99 seconds.
There are 10 levels to pass for winning.
Note that somethimes there is a gun that fly and that can let you lose a live..
... and a running running object ... maybe a 'live' object ...

TECNIQUES:
* An actor is made by 2 multicolor sprites: the upper part and the lower part.
* Another 2 sprites are used for damage action
* Sprites were painted as usual using the Andrew Colin's BASIC sprites program
  and Gimp
* Chars were created using my LSS2 map editor.


OPTIMIZATIONS:
Here are some steps taken:
* Sprites are defined for the left actor only. The ones for the right are
  calculated at runtime by mirroring the others. Note that we mirror multicolor
  sprites, not siglecolor ones. 
* Screen at $0400 and color at $D800 are precalculated and put as 2KB of data
  into the source. Belive or not, Exomizer compress them a lot as they are
  like all equal (unfortunately they have to be relocated to the right
  position as Exomizer actually doesn't manage that address directly)
* Redefined chars are already at the right place and are not to be relocated
* The music is processed by TINY and the bytes of player never used are filled
  with 0

note: there is a bonus stereo version of the tune in this pack: use second sid 
at address D420

THANKS:
Thanks to all the authors of tools I used to make this game:
Vice, Exomizer, Dasm.
