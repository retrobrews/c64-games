This is a silly 4 kilobyte game I did for the 2016 4K Crap Game compo.
Yes, the whole game is just 4k of ram, compressed. So, don't panic when 
you run it and you see garbage on the screen for several seconds, 
it's just the game unpacking into memory.

So, what is it?

Well, it's a daft reaction game where you just have to react to whether 
Ben Turpin is winking or blinking. By pushing left or right on the 
joystick you select whether he is blinking (both eyes) or winking (one eye). 
You need to be quick as if you take too long, your score is reset and Ben's 
eyes go bonkers.
Push the wrong way and do a wink selection for a blink or a blink selection 
for a wink and you fail. Yes, Ben's eyes go bonkers again and into a spin.

Code anfd gfx by me with some additional cleanups by Vanja Utne of Pond/Privy.
Music/sfx also done in a very minimal amount of ram by Vanja Utne.

There's no title screen or anything due to the lack of memory. I didn't even 
have a byte free. Exactly 4096 bytes (4kb) on disk.
