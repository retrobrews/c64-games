CONTEXT

Athanor takes place in the south of Italy in the 12th Century. You are playing as a Franciscan monk, sent by his 
Holy order in order to make an inquiry in an abbey where suspect events have aroused many fears. You will lead 
this inquiry in order to discover the mysteries lying within this abbey. Let your conscience be your guide and 
you may discover greater secrets that you could have thought of.

SYNTACTIC ANALYZER

Playing through Athanor, you will have to type your orders such as :
Verb + Noun
(Example: Examine door, Search chest).

In some cases, you may be allowed to use more specific commands such as :
Examine left door.

However, do try to respect a few rules :
- Verb must be put in the infinitive form

Some Basic languages are less powerful than others to analyze commands.
