Roll Roll Roll is a dice game where you roll a single six sided dice where you can win money.
On the first roll, you have the option to keep your roll as cash or roll again. Similarly, 
on the second roll, you have the same two options again. On the third and final roll, you keep 
whatever you roll (whatever the outcome). There are 10 rounds to a game.

This is based on a mathematics problem with worked out from the averages of rolling three dice 
in the hope of scoring the most points. The aim of the game is to beat the average (3.5) or 
optimally (4.66 for 3 rolls).
