This game is based off one of the pricing games from the US version of The Price Is Right. 
The player is given 10 flat discs which are released one at a time from the top of the board.  
The game board consists of a number of pegs which bounce the disc randomly around. 
As the disc falls to the bottom, it is impossible to determine where the disc might end up. 
At the bottom of the board, the disc stop and lands in a money slot the player can win.

The game was put through 100,000 rounds and it is theoretically possible to get the top amount 
from anywhere the disc is dropped from on the board. However, you do have a greater chance of 
winning money from the middle, but it is also twice as likely that you will get nothing as well.
