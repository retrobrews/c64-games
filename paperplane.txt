I wrote this C64 game in 2014.  Can be played in your favourite Commodore 64 emulator. This is the PAL version (if playing on hardware).
In this game you must guide your paper plane through the hazards. You can use left / right to steer and adjust your speed.
This is the uncracked, untrained version.

Free to download. Quite niche for C64 lovers who like casual games.

UPDATE: There is now also an updated version of Paper Plane as an Easter Egg game inside Jason Aldred's Steam version of the C64 game, Galencia.
