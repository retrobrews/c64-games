     <desc>This game is based on a mathematics game theory problem of 100 people. However, the game simulates the problem with just one player. The computer selects a random number from 00 to 99 as your lucky number. You will need to guess which box from 00-99 where the lucky number is hidden. The game allows you to have up to 50 guesses, but it's not easy to win as it sounds!</desc>

     <desc>This game is based off one of the pricing games from the US version of The Price Is Right. The player is given 10 flat discs which are released one at a time from the top of the board.  The game board consists of a number of pegs which bounce the disc randomly around. As the disc falls to the bottom, it is impossible to determine where the disc might end up. At the bottom of the board, the disc stop and lands in a money slot the player can win. The game was put through 100,000 rounds and it is theoretically possible to get the top amount from anywhere the disc is dropped from on the board. However, you do have a greater chance of winning money from the middle, but it is also twice as likely that you will get nothing as well.</desc>
