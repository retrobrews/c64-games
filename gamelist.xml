     <desc>This game is based on a mathematics game theory problem of 100 people. However, the game simulates the problem with just one player. The computer selects a random number from 00 to 99 as your lucky number. You will need to guess which box from 00-99 where the lucky number is hidden. The game allows you to have up to 50 guesses, but it's not easy to win as it sounds!</desc>

     <name>Nanako in Classic Japanese Monster Castle [C64]</name>
     <desc>In this game you control Nanako. The game consists on 25 levels, each one representing one of the floors in the tower. In each one, to reach the following level you have to literally build up your path to the top of the screen. This can be managed with Nanako's ability to carry boxes (only one at a time) and drop them elsewhere. In each screen you'll find a Karakasa which sometimes will cause real trouble. Nanako is able to walk over a still Karakasa, but if it eventually moves Nanako could fall from its top and be caught by it, losing a valuable life. To be able to use a Karakasa as a stand to jump and reach higher is decisive in some of the levels. Another useful thing Nanako is able to do is to release a box in mid air, during a jump, causing the box to appear where she is and stay in the middle of the air. It's very important to master the ability to drop the box in the highest point of a jump, gaining fast access to upper levels. At the beginning of each levels a password is given (using the Kun alphabet) which we can use to access directly to that level instead of having to start over once and again. Use LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN to write the password and JUMP to validate it.</desc>

The game board consists of a number of pegs which bounce the disc randomly around. As the disc falls to the bottom, it is impossible to determine where the disc might end up. At the bottom of the board, the disc stop and lands in a money slot the player can win. The game was put through 100,000 rounds and it is theoretically possible to get the top amount from anywhere the disc is dropped from on the board. However, you do have a greater chance of winning money from the middle, but it is also twice as likely that you will get nothing as well.</desc>

Zampo needs to eat/drink constantly to avoid starvation and to reach full satisfaction. Zampo's satisfaction is indicated by the belly satisfaction meter. It decreases steadily (the higher the level, the faster the decrease rate) and, if it depletes entirely, it triggers the game over. When the belly satisfaction meter is maxed out, a toilet zips across on a platform other than the one which Zampo is on: Zampo has to catch it before it disappears in order to complete the level. If the toilet is missed, the game is over.</desc>

     <desc>The game is a simple run and gun scenario with some dubious combat sections. Simply make your way around the obstacle course 3 times to gain access to the fight room. This is a kind of Running Man thing. The better you do, the more years you can shave off your prison sentence. Hence the name! Clever eh? No? Well, meh...whatever.</desc>

You can regain some lost breath eating some magical legs of monegros' fried chicken which you will find scattered around the already visited screens.</desc>

     <desc>SNAFU '64 is a classic snake trap game where you must direct your snake so that it always has room to keep moving freely. At the same time, try to block your opponents so that they are forced into a collision. If a snake collides with the edge of the picture, with an obstacle, with another snake or with part of itself, it is killed and eliminated from the round.</desc>

When a random character is displayed on the screen, you have to press the same character on the keyboard to draw and shoot your gun! You can press "F8" to activate/de-activate the trainer. This can only be done on the intro screen. If you have a disk-drive or you play the D64 version on an emulator, the game has a built-in high score saver.</desc>

     <desc>The game is about to steal the most amount of coins possible. Uwol won't want to end his mission until he collects a minimum of 255 of those. The manor rooms are arranged like a pyramid, starting from the very top, and after you clean a room of coins you will be given the chance to choose which path (left or right) to take. You select a path walking over one of the arrows which appear and pressing DOWN. If you get to the bottom of the pyramid and you haven't gathered enough coins you get back to top and start over. This time, you should choose another path 'cause the already visited rooms will be empty. Use the pyramid map to know which rooms are visited and which aren't. You have three enemies which follow pretty linear paths, but once the time ends one of them will summon Fanty which will chase you relentlessly all accross the screen. During gameplay, if you touch a baddie you'll lose your clothes. Look for a tee-shirt nearby, otherwise you'll die on the next touch by a baddie. When you get a certain ammount of points, you'll be rewarded with an extra life.</desc>

By pushing left or right on the joystick you select whether he is blinking (both eyes) or winking (one eye). You need to be quick as if you take too long, your score is reset and Ben's eyes go bonkers.Push the wrong way and do a wink selection for a blink or a blink selection for a wink and you fail. Yes, Ben's eyes go bonkers again and into a spin.</desc>
