Designer Notes:

My love letter, sort of, to games like Paradroid, Xevious, Aztec Challenge, and Alcazar that captured my imagination and lots of time in my youth. -Mo Dernart
The game includes additional homage to Shoot'em Up Construction kit and in particular, in the introductory level - Slap and Tickle (albeit with new graphics and animation for our beloved evil bizarro-character version)!
