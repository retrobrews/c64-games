It's an action game, set in an arcade and platform themes. The object is to destroy all the monsters on screen that chase the player around the level.
Okay, this is an old C64 game I wrote that can be played in your favourite Commodore 64 emulator.
This is the uncracked, untrained version.

Free to download. One for the retro heads.
