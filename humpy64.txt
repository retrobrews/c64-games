Okay, this is an unfinished casual C64 game I wrote that can be played in 
your favourite Commodore 64 emulator.  (PAL version).
Update: There is an "NTSC fixed" and "cracked" version by Excess floating 
about, but that's somewhat destructive to the scores in the border. Play 
this one on PAL or emulator in PAL mode for a cleaner version with music 
at the correct speed.

I decided to cease work on this super simple game that has been lingering 
for a while now.

What do you have to do? Well, not much.... just survive from being hit by 
the swinging ball as long as you can. It slowly gets faster and some wind 
will affect you too, so you have to counteract the wind  by pushing 
left/right to stay on the podium.
Jump with fire... you can double jump if that sort of thing floats yer 
boat.

Although not complete, you can still play it and try to beat your best scores, 
but what's missing is:
Front End,
Tailored music/sfx,
Animated water ripples/water fall,
No highscore name entry.
Oh, there was also going to be a little mini intro/bit of story... but meh.

Code by me, bitmap by Vanja Utne, additional gfx by me and music (stand in) 
is by MCH. (Cheesecat Groove is the tune).

Free to download (or optionally donate). One for the retro heads.
