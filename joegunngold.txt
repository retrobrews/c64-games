JOE GUNN - GOLD EDITION
=======================

Welcome to JOE GUNN - GOLD EDITION, the 8th release from Psytronik Software (in association with Cronosoft).

This .zip file contains both the English and German versions of the game as .TAP files which you can load into a C64 emulator like VICE or CCS64.


WHAT IS A .TAP FILE?
====================

A .TAP file is a C64 tape image file suitable for emulators.  When loaded into an emulator a .TAP file authentically recreates the tape loading experience.  You can listen to the loading music and observe the loading screen while the program loads - it's exactly like loading a tape on a real C64.  Of course, if you want to speed things up you can always increase the speed of your emulator.


WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE EMULATORS?
===================================

Two of the most popular C64 emulators are VICE and CCS64.  You can download the latest version of VICE from http://www.viceteam.org/ and CCS64 is available from http://www.computerbrains.com/ccs64/


HOW DO I LOAD THE .TAP FILES INTO VICE?
=======================================

Firstly, extract the .TAP files from this .ZIP file.  Now, load up the VICE: C64 Emulator and you will soon be faced with a familiar blue startup screen.  Now pull down the File menu and select 'Autostart tape/disk image...' The file select window will appear.  Browse to where you extracted the .TAP files, change the 'Files of type' option to 'Tape image files' and then double-click the .TAP file you wish to load.  The game will now load in exactly the same was the real C64 tape version.


HOW DO I LOAD THE .TAP FILES INTO CCS64?

If you are using the Windows version of CCS64 you can load .TAP files by pulling down the '-File' menu.  Choose 'Load and Run...' and browse to where you extacted the .TAP files.  Make sure 'Files of type' has 'All C64 Files' selected and the .TAP images should show in the browser window.
