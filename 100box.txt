This game is based on a mathematics game theory problem of 100 people. However, the game simulates the problem with just one player. 

The computer selects a random number from 00 to 99 as your lucky number. 
You will need to guess which box from 00-99 where the lucky number is hidden.

The game allows you to have up to 50 guesses, but it’s not easy to win as it sounds!
